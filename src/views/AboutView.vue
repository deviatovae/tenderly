    <p class="text-body-1 font-weight-medium">The idea of creating this app comes from a desire to be more mindful about feelings and
      emotions happening during the day. Writing down whatâ€™s on our mind is a meaningful and effective way to process
      your feelings.<br>
      Take five minutes out of your day to pause and think what bothers your mind, listen to the relaxing
      sounds and write your thoughts.</p>
